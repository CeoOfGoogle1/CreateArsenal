# **Create: Arsenal**
This is an addon for the Minecraft Create mod, which adds an extended system of stationary personal defense weapons. It was made regarding the lack of protection of builds offered by the upcoming addon of "Create Aeronautics". 
(~~Of course you can also strap a minigun on your blimp and commit spawnkilling we aren't judging~~)

## **Installation**
To install this addon, you will need to have the Minecraft Create mod as well as the Flywheel api mod installed first. At the time being, this mod is only for the forge version of the create mod, but there will be a fabric port in the foreseeable future.

## **Features**
+ New machines: Several new guns are added to the game, including stationary ones and some that can rotate on the x,y and z axis.
+ New Mechanics: Guns need cooling, you'll have to automate that so the guns don't overheat.
+ Extended Ammunition system: A immersive ammo system including flak rounds, as well as incindiary and armor piercing bullets.
+ Regular updates: We have a hardworking community of artists and coders trying hard to make the mod as attractive as possible, considering the wishes and ideas of the community.

## **Compatibility**
This addon is compatible with the latest version of the Minecraft Create mod. It may not be compatible with other mods, so be sure to check compatibility before installing.

## **Support**
